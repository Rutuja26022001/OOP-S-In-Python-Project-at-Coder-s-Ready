#  1)SNAKE-GAME-DEVELOPMENT
How to Implement Snake Game In Python By Using OOP'S Concept

### By using an oop's language involving multiple object and classes to design snake game that allow to user to control the movement of snake .the mainobjective of player is to catch the maximum number of furits without hitting itself.

#### step towards sucessfully game Implimentation is :
##### Table of content:
- Installing Pygame
- Create the Screen
- Create the Snake
- Moving the Snake
- Displaying the Score
- Game Over when Snake hits the boundaries
- Adding the Food
- Increasing the Length of the Snake

- consequently ,the billing system help the companies to improve their performance and reduce error's by automating documents preparation and other routine task .
- billing system is complex software that create and automates payment and inovices.

## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS TO MUCH USE FOR THIS APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

### Tkinter
- Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions.
- The main advantage of using Tkinter is that it has an object-oriented interface. The success of any application or website depends on how well it interacts with the user, i.e. an attractive graphical interface helps to create a good application.
- kinter is the standard built-in GUI library for Python, and, with over 41,000 stars on GitHub, it's the most popular Python GUI framework
### Objective
1)Creating a mall billing dashboard, that can take information like name, phone number, number of units of medical purpose items, grocery items and cold drinks from user and generate bill with respective taxes with unique bill number.

2)Adding buttons like clear, generate bill, clear, exit fro performing different functions on given data.

3)Creating highly interactive Mall Billing Dashboard.
